clickSuck
---------

###Click event not firing in IOS?

This totally fixes it. 

###How to use?

Include 

    <script src='../src/clickSuck.js'></script>

Initialize it in your own JavaScript:

    clickSuck.init();

That's it.

###Will Safari Ever fix their browser

I hope so. But I'll never get all that time spent debugging back. 

###Does it really work?

See a small Qunit test page on
