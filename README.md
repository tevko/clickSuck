## Click event not firing in IOS?

This totally fixes it. 

### How to use?

Include 

    <script src='../src/clickSuck.js'></script>

Initialize it in your own JavaScript:

    clickSuck.init();

That's it.

### Will Safari Ever fix their browser

I hope so. But I'll never get all that time spent debugging back. 

### Does it really work?

See a small Qunit test page on
